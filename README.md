Introduction

This repository demonstrates the use of Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm to solve real-world routing problems. The goal is to determine the optimal path between two locations while considering various route constraints, such as distance and time.

Features

	â€¢	Shortest Path Calculation: Implements Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm for optimal route planning.
	â€¢	Customizable Graph: Modify nodes and edge weights to represent different routes and distances.
	â€¢	Detailed Output: Provides step-by-step instructions and visualizations of the optimal path.

Installation

To get started, clone this repository and install the required dependencies.

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/optimal-path-finder.git
cd optimal-path-finder
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

	1.	Define your graph with nodes (locations) and edges (routes with weights).
	2.	Run the script to calculate the shortest path.

python optimal_path.py

	3.	View the optimal route and distance in the output.

Example

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how the graph is defined and used:

graph = {
    'Coppell': {'Irving': 10, 'Carrollton': 8},
    'Irving': {'Dallas': 15},
    'Carrollton': {'Dallas': 12, 'Midlothian': 20},
    'Dallas': {'Midlothian': 10},
    'Midlothian': {}
}

start = 'Coppell'
end = 'Midlothian'

optimal_path, distance = dijkstra(graph, start, end)
print(f"The optimal path is: {optimal_path} with a total distance of {distance} units.")
